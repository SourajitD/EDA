# EDA

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in the data analysis process that involves the visualization, summarization, and interpretation of data to gain insights into patterns, relationships, and anomalies in the data. EDA methods help analysts identify potential issues with the data, formulate hypotheses, and make informed decisions about subsequent analysis steps.

This EDA Web App has been made to automate the process using Streamlit, YData-Profiling & SweetViz libraries in Python.
